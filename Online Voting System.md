# Online Voting System

Designing an Online Voting System involves managing various components such as voters, candidates, ballots, voting sessions, and the system itself to facilitate voting operations. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

## Components:

**1.  Voter:** Represents a voter in the system with details like voter ID, name, contact information, etc. <br />
**2.  Candidate:** Represents a candidate in the election with details like candidate ID, name, party affiliation, etc. <br />
**3.  Ballot:** Represents a ballot for a particular election with details like ballot ID, list of candidates, voting status, etc. <br />
**4.  VotingSession:** Represents a voting session for a particular election with details like session ID, start time, end time, etc. <br />
**5.  Vote:** Represents a vote cast by a voter for a candidate on a ballot. <br />
**6.  VotingSystem:** Manages voters, candidates, ballots, voting sessions, and facilitates voting operations. <br />

## Interactions:

**1.  Voter casts a vote:**
Voter selects a candidate and casts a vote.
VotingSystem records the vote and updates the voting status of the ballot.

**2.  VotingSystem manages voting sessions and ballots:**
*  Manages the list of registered voters and candidates.
*  Creates ballots for each election with a list of candidates.
*  Starts and ends voting sessions for each election.
*  Records votes cast by voters and updates the voting status of the ballot.

```ruby
import java.util.*;

class Voter {
    private String voterId;
    private String name;
    private String contactInfo;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Candidate {
    private String candidateId;
    private String name;
    private String partyAffiliation;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Ballot {
    private String ballotId;
    private List<Candidate> candidates;
    private boolean isOpen;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class VotingSession {
    private String sessionId;
    private Date startTime;
    private Date endTime;
    private boolean isActive;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Vote {
    private String voteId;
    private Voter voter;
    private Candidate candidate;
    private Ballot ballot;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class VotingSystem {
    private List<Voter> voters;
    private List<Candidate> candidates;
    private Map<String, Ballot> ballots;
    private Map<String, VotingSession> votingSessions;
    private List<Vote> votes;

    public VotingSystem() {
        this.voters = new ArrayList<>();
        this.candidates = new ArrayList<>();
        this.ballots = new HashMap<>();
        this.votingSessions = new HashMap<>();
        this.votes = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void registerVoter(Voter voter) {
        voters.add(voter);
    }

    public void addCandidate(Candidate candidate) {
        candidates.add(candidate);
    }

    public void createBallot(String ballotId, List<Candidate> candidates) {
        Ballot ballot = new Ballot(ballotId, candidates, true);
        ballots.put(ballotId, ballot);
    }

    public void startVotingSession(String sessionId, Date startTime, Date endTime) {
        VotingSession votingSession = new VotingSession(sessionId, startTime, endTime, true);
        votingSessions.put(sessionId, votingSession);
    }

    public void endVotingSession(String sessionId) {
        VotingSession votingSession = votingSessions.get(sessionId);
        if (votingSession != null) {
            votingSession.setActive(false);
        }
    }

    public void castVote(Voter voter, Candidate candidate, Ballot ballot) {
        if (ballot.isOpen() && votingSessions.get(ballot.getBallotId()).isActive()) {
            Vote vote = new Vote(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), voter, candidate, ballot);
            votes.add(vote);
            ballot.setOpen(false);
        }
    }

    // Other methods for result calculation, audit trail, etc.
}

```
In this design:

The **Voter** class represents a voter in the system with details like voter ID, name, contact information, etc. <br />
The **Candidate** class represents a candidate in the election with details like candidate ID, name, party affiliation, etc. <br />
The **Ballot** class represents a ballot for a particular election with details like ballot ID, list of candidates, voting status, etc. <br />
The **VotingSession** class represents a voting session for a particular election with details like session ID, start time, end time, etc. <br />
The **Vote** class represents a vote cast by a voter for a candidate on a ballot. <br />
The **VotingSystem** class manages voters, candidates, ballots, voting sessions, and facilitates voting operations. <br />

This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional features like authentication, authorization, encryption for sensitive information, voter verification, result calculation, audit trail, notifications, and more. Additionally, error handling, concurrency control, and database integration would be crucial for a production-level system.
