# Travel Booking System

Designing a Travel Booking System requires managing various components like users, bookings, accommodations, flights, and other travel services. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

## Components:

**1. User:** Represents a user of the system with details like name, contact information, etc. <br />
**2. Accommodation**: Represents a place to stay with details like name, address, price, availability, etc. <br />
**3, Flight:** Represents a flight with details like flight number, origin, destination, departure time, etc. <br />
**4. Booking:** Represents a booking made by a user for accommodation, flight, or other services. <br />
**5. TravelServiceManager:** Manages accommodations, flights, bookings, and facilitates booking operations. <br />

## Interactions:

**1. User books a service:**
*  User selects a service (accommodation, flight, etc.) and provides necessary details.
*  TravelServiceManager checks availability and creates a booking if the service is available.
*  Booking confirmation is sent to the user.
  
**2. TravelServiceManager manages services and bookings:**

*  Manages the list of available accommodations, flights, and other travel services.
*  Manages the list of bookings made for each service.
*  Handles booking operations like adding, canceling, or modifying bookings.

```ruby

import java.util.*;

class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String contactInfo;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Accommodation {
    private String accommodationId;
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private double pricePerNight;
    private int totalRooms;
    private int availableRooms;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Flight {
    private String flightNumber;
    private String origin;
    private String destination;
    private Date departureTime;
    private int totalSeats;
    private int availableSeats;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Booking {
    private String bookingId;
    private Object service; // Can be Accommodation, Flight, or other services
    private User user;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class TravelServiceManager {
    private List<Accommodation> accommodations;
    private List<Flight> flights;
    private Map<Object, List<Booking>> bookings; // Object can be Accommodation, Flight, etc.

    public TravelServiceManager() {
        this.accommodations = new ArrayList<>();
        this.flights = new ArrayList<>();
        this.bookings = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addAccommodation(Accommodation accommodation) {
        accommodations.add(accommodation);
        bookings.put(accommodation, new ArrayList<>());
    }

    public void addFlight(Flight flight) {
        flights.add(flight);
        bookings.put(flight, new ArrayList<>());
    }

    public String bookService(Object service, User user) {
        if (!bookings.containsKey(service)) {
            return "Service not found.";
        }

        List<Booking> serviceBookings = bookings.get(service);
        if (service instanceof Accommodation) {
            Accommodation accommodation = (Accommodation) service;
            if (accommodation.getAvailableRooms() <= 0) {
                return "No available rooms in this accommodation.";
            }
            serviceBookings.add(new Booking(generateBookingId(), accommodation, user));
            accommodation.setAvailableRooms(accommodation.getAvailableRooms() - 1);
        } else if (service instanceof Flight) {
            Flight flight = (Flight) service;
            if (flight.getAvailableSeats() <= 0) {
                return "No available seats on this flight.";
            }
            serviceBookings.add(new Booking(generateBookingId(), flight, user));
            flight.setAvailableSeats(flight.getAvailableSeats() - 1);
        }

        return "Booking successful.";
    }

    private String generateBookingId() {
        // Generate unique booking ID logic
    }

    // Other methods like cancelBooking, getBookingsByService, etc.
}

```
In this design:

*  The User class represents a user of the system with details like name and contact information.
*  The Accommodation class represents a place to stay with details like name, address, etc.
*  The Flight class represents a flight with details like flight number, origin, destination, etc.
*  The Booking class represents a booking made by a user for accommodation, flight, or other services.
*  The TravelServiceManager class manages accommodations, flights, bookings, and facilitates booking operations.

This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional features like payment processing, search and filtering options, authentication, and more. Additionally, error handling, concurrency control, and database integration would be crucial for a production-level system.
