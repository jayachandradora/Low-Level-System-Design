Designing a Travel Booking System requires managing various components like users, bookings, accommodations, flights, and other travel services. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

## Components:

**1. User:** Represents a user of the system with details like name, contact information, etc.
**2. Accommodation**: Represents a place to stay with details like name, address, price, availability, etc.
**3, Flight:** Represents a flight with details like flight number, origin, destination, departure time, etc.
**4. Booking:** Represents a booking made by a user for accommodation, flight, or other services.
**TravelServiceManager:** Manages accommodations, flights, bookings, and facilitates booking operations.

## Interactions:

**1. User books a service:**
*  User selects a service (accommodation, flight, etc.) and provides necessary details.
*  TravelServiceManager checks availability and creates a booking if the service is available.
*  Booking confirmation is sent to the user.
*  TravelServiceManager manages services and bookings:
*  Manages the list of available accommodations, flights, and other travel services.
*  Manages the list of bookings made for each service.
*  Handles booking operations like adding, canceling, or modifying bookings.
