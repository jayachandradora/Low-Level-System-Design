# Social Media Platform

Designing a Social Media Platform involves managing various components such as users, posts, comments, likes, and the system itself to facilitate interactions between users. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

## Components:

**1.  User:** Represents a user of the platform with details like user ID, name, contact information, etc.<br />
**2.  Post:** Represents a post created by a user with details like post ID, content, timestamp, etc.<br />
**3.  Comment:** Represents a comment made on a post with details like comment ID, content, timestamp, etc.<br />
**4.  Like:** Represents a like given by a user on a post or comment.<br />
**5.  SocialMediaPlatform:** Manages users, posts, comments, likes, and facilitates interactions between users.<br />

## Interactions:

**1. User creates a post:**

*  User creates a new post with content.
*  SocialMediaPlatform adds the post to the user's profile and displays it to followers.
  
**2.  User comments on a post:**
*  User writes a comment on a post.
*  SocialMediaPlatform adds the comment to the post and notifies the post owner and other users.
  
**3.  User likes a post or comment:**
*  User likes a post or comment.
*  SocialMediaPlatform records the like and updates the like count.

    public void likeComment(String commentId, User user) {

}

In this design:

The **User** class represents a user of the platform with details like user ID, name, contact information, etc. <br />
The **Post** class represents a post created by a user with details like post ID, content, author, timestamp, etc. <br />
The **Comment** class represents a comment made on a post with details like comment ID, content, author, timestamp, etc.<br />
The **Like** class represents a like given by a user on a post or comment. <br />
The **SocialMediaPlatform** class manages users, posts, comments, likes, and facilitates interactions between users.<br />

This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional features like authentication, authorization, encryption for sensitive information, search and filtering options, notifications, and more. Additionally, error handling, concurrency control, and database integration would be crucial for a production-level system.
