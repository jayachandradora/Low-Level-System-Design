Designing a payment system for applications like hotel management, ticket booking, or flight booking involves multiple components, each responsible for handling different aspects of the payment process. Below, I'll provide a low-level design focusing on key classes and interactions within a payment system.

### Components of the Payment System

1. **Payment Gateway**: Interface for processing payments.
2. **Payment Method**: Interface for different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
3. **Order**: Represents a booking or transaction.
4. **User**: Represents the customer making a payment.
5. **Payment Processor**: Handles the interaction with the payment gateway.
6. **Transaction**: Represents the transaction details.

### Class Diagram

Here's a high-level class diagram representation (described in text):

```
+------------------+         +--------------------+
|      User        |         |      Order         |
+------------------+         +--------------------+

+-------------------+          +---------------------+
```

### Classes and Their Responsibilities

#### 1. User Class

```java
public class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructor, Getters, and Setters
}
```

#### 2. Order Class

```java
public class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private double amount;
    private String status; // e.g., "PENDING", "COMPLETED", "FAILED"

    // Constructor, Getters, and Setters
}
```

#### 3. PaymentMethod Interface

```java
public interface PaymentMethod {
    boolean pay(double amount);
}
```

#### 4. Credit & Debit Card, UPI, Net Banking & Cash Payment Class

```java
public class Credit&DebitCardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    private String cardNumber;
    private String expiryDate;
    private String cardType; // Visa, MasterCard, Amex, etc.

    public CreditCardPayment(String cardNumber, String expiryDate, String cardType) {
        this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
        this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
        this.cardType = cardType;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean pay(double amount) {
        // Payment processing logic
        // Validate card details and process payment
        return true; // Assume payment is successful for simplicity
    }
}

// PayPal Payment
public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    private String email;

    public PayPalPayment(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean pay(double amount) {
        // PayPal payment processing logic
        return true; // Assume payment is successful for simplicity
    }
}

// Internet Banking Payment
public class InternetBankingPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    private String bankAccountNumber;

    public InternetBankingPayment(String bankAccountNumber) {
        this.bankAccountNumber = bankAccountNumber;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean pay(double amount) {
        // Internet banking payment processing logic
        return true; // Assume payment is successful for simplicity
    }
}

// UPI Payment
public class UpiPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    private String upiId;

    public UpiPayment(String upiId) {
        this.upiId = upiId;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean pay(double amount) {
        // UPI payment processing logic
        return true; // Assume payment is successful for simplicity
    }
}

// Cash on Delivery Payment
public class CashOnDeliveryPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    @Override
    public boolean pay(double amount) {
        // Logic for cash on delivery
        return true; // Assume payment is successful for simplicity
    }
}

```

#### 5. PaymentProcessor Class

```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGateway gateway;

    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }

    public boolean processPayment(PaymentMethod method, Order order) {
        if (method.pay(order.getAmount())) {
            // Assuming payment was successful
            order.setStatus("COMPLETED");
            return true;
        } else {
            order.setStatus("FAILED");
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 6. PaymentGateway Class

```java
public class PaymentGateway {
    public boolean authorize(double amount) {
        // Authorize payment logic (e.g., interact with external payment service)
        return true; // Simulating successful authorization
    }

    public boolean capture(double amount) {
        // Capture payment logic
        return true; // Simulating successful capture
    }

    public boolean refund(double amount) {
        // Refund payment logic
        return true; // Simulating successful refund
    }
}
```

### Usage Example

```java
public class PaymentSystemDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User user = new User("1", "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");
        Order order = new Order("123", 200.00, "PENDING");

        // Create payment method
        PaymentMethod paymentMethod = new CreditCardPayment("4111111111111111", "12/25");

        // Create payment processor and gateway
        PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();
        PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(paymentGateway);

        // Process payment
        boolean paymentSuccess = paymentProcessor.processPayment(paymentMethod, order);

        System.out.println("Payment Success: " + paymentSuccess);
        System.out.println("Order Status: " + order.getStatus());
    }
}
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Extensibility**: The design allows for adding new payment methods (e.g., PayPal, bank transfer) without changing existing code.
2. **Encapsulation**: Payment logic is encapsulated within the respective classes.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a specific responsibility, making the system more maintainable and testable.
4. **Error Handling**: Real implementations would require robust error handling, logging, and security measures (e.g., PCI compliance).

### Use Cases

1. **Hotel Management**: Manage reservations, payments for stays, and cancellation policies.
2. **Ticket Booking**: Handle payments for events, flights, or travel.
3. **Flight Booking**: Process payments for airline tickets, including baggage fees and extras.

Certainly! Let's explore the provided classes and their interactions through the lens of the SOLID principles and incorporate relevant design patterns. This will help improve the design, maintainability, and scalability of the payment processing system.

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - Each class should have one reason to change.
   - In the provided classes:
     - `User`, `Order`, and `PaymentMethod` adhere to SRP as they manage user data, order details, and payment processes, respectively.
     - `PaymentProcessor` is responsible for processing payments, and `PaymentGateway` handles interactions with external payment services.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - The `PaymentMethod` interface allows for the addition of new payment methods (like `PayPalPayment`) without modifying existing code.
   - You can extend the `PaymentGateway` class to support different payment providers without altering its interface.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Any class implementing `PaymentMethod` (like `CreditCardPayment` or any future payment class) should work seamlessly with `PaymentProcessor`.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - The `PaymentMethod` interface is specific to payment methods. If more functionality is needed in the future, itâ€™s better to create additional interfaces rather than cluttering existing ones.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions.
   - The `PaymentProcessor` depends on the `PaymentMethod` interface and the `PaymentGateway`, allowing for easy swapping of implementations without altering higher-level logic.

### Design Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - The `PaymentMethod` interface exemplifies the Strategy pattern, allowing different payment methods to be defined and used interchangeably.
   - For example, you could implement `PayPalPayment` as another strategy without changing `PaymentProcessor`.

2. **Factory Pattern**:
   - To create instances of `PaymentMethod`, you could implement a Factory class that encapsulates the instantiation logic. This way, you can add new payment methods more easily.
   ```java
   public class PaymentMethodFactory {
       public static PaymentMethod createPaymentMethod(String type, String... details) {
           switch (type) {
               case "CREDIT_CARD":
                   return new CreditCardPayment(details[0], details[1]);
               case "PAYPAL":
                   return new PayPalPayment(details[0]);
               default:
                   throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown payment method type");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - If you want to notify other components (like sending a confirmation email) when the order status changes, you could use the Observer pattern. The `Order` class can maintain a list of observers that get notified when its status changes.

4. **Decorator Pattern**:
   - If you want to add additional features to payment methods (like logging or applying discounts), you could use the Decorator pattern. This allows you to wrap existing payment methods with new behavior without changing their structure.
   ```java
   public class LoggingPaymentDecorator implements PaymentMethod {
       private PaymentMethod paymentMethod;

       public LoggingPaymentDecorator(PaymentMethod paymentMethod) {
           this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
       }

       @Override
       public boolean pay(double amount) {
           System.out.println("Processing payment of " + amount);
           return paymentMethod.pay(amount);
       }
   }
   ```

### Updated Example with Design Patterns

Hereâ€™s how the payment processing system might look with these principles and patterns applied:

```java
// Factory Pattern Example
PaymentMethod paymentMethod = PaymentMethodFactory.createPaymentMethod("CREDIT_CARD", "4111111111111111", "12/25");

// Decorator Pattern Example
PaymentMethod loggingPaymentMethod = new LoggingPaymentDecorator(paymentMethod);

// Processing payment with the decorated method
boolean paymentSuccess = paymentProcessor.processPayment(loggingPaymentMethod, order);
```

### Conclusion

By applying SOLID principles and incorporating design patterns, we can enhance the flexibility and maintainability of the payment processing system. Each component has a clear responsibility, making it easier to test, extend, and modify the codebase as requirements evolve. The use of design patterns further decouples components, allowing for cleaner architecture and improved scalability.


Certainly! Let's dive into the concepts of **high cohesion** and **low coupling** within the context of the provided payment processing system code, and explain their significance through practical use cases.

### High Cohesion

**Definition**: High cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module (or class) are. A class with high cohesion has a well-defined purpose and its methods are related to that purpose, which enhances readability, maintainability, and reusability.

#### Use Case in the Payment Processing System

**Example**: The `Order` class

```java
public class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private double amount;
    private String status; // e.g., "PENDING", "COMPLETED", "FAILED"

    public Order(String orderId, double amount, String status) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.amount = amount;
        this.status = status;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getOrderId() { return orderId; }
    public double getAmount() { return amount; }
    public String getStatus() { return status; }
    public void setStatus(String status) { this.status = status; }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Cohesive Responsibilities**: The `Order` class is responsible for managing order details, including the order ID, amount, and status. All methods in this class are directly related to the functionality of handling orders.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Readability**: Itâ€™s clear that any method you call on an `Order` object pertains to the order itself.
  - **Maintainability**: If changes are needed related to orders (like adding a new property), they can be localized within this class.
  - **Reusability**: The `Order` class can be reused in other parts of the system where order management is necessary.

### Low Coupling

**Definition**: Low coupling refers to minimizing dependencies between different modules (or classes). When classes are loosely coupled, changes in one class are less likely to require changes in another, leading to a more flexible and maintainable system.

#### Use Case in the Payment Processing System

**Example**: The `PaymentProcessor` class and the `PaymentMethod` interface

```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGateway gateway;

    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }

    public boolean processPayment(PaymentMethod method, Order order) {
        if (method.pay(order.getAmount())) {
            order.setStatus("COMPLETED");
            return true;
        } else {
            order.setStatus("FAILED");
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Loose Coupling**: The `PaymentProcessor` class depends on the `PaymentMethod` interface, not on specific implementations (like `CreditCardPayment`). This means it can work with any payment method that adheres to the `PaymentMethod` interface, allowing for easy extension.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Flexibility**: If a new payment method (e.g., `PayPalPayment`) is added, you can introduce it without modifying the `PaymentProcessor` class.
  - **Isolation**: Changes in the `CreditCardPayment` class won't affect the `PaymentProcessor` as long as the interface remains unchanged.
  - **Testability**: You can easily create mock implementations of `PaymentMethod` for unit testing `PaymentProcessor`, facilitating more straightforward testing processes.

### Summary

- **High Cohesion** in the `Order` class makes it focused and easy to manage, ensuring that all methods are related to order functionalities.
- **Low Coupling** in the interaction between `PaymentProcessor` and `PaymentMethod` allows for flexibility and adaptability, making the system resilient to changes.

By maintaining high cohesion and low coupling, the design of the payment processing system becomes robust, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain and extend in the future.
