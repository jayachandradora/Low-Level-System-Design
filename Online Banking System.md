# Online Banking System

Designing an Online Banking System involves managing various components such as users, accounts, transactions, and the system itself to facilitate banking operations. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

##Components:

**1.  User:** Represents a user of the system with details like name, contact information, etc.
**2.  Account:** Represents a bank account with details like account number, balance, account type, etc.
**3.  Transaction:** Represents a transaction made on an account with details like transaction ID, amount, type, timestamp, etc.
**4.  BankingSystem:** Manages users, accounts, transactions, and facilitates banking operations.

## Interactions:

**1.  User performs banking operations:**

*  User logs in to the system and selects the desired banking operation (e.g., deposit, withdraw, transfer).
*  BankingSystem validates the user's credentials and performs the requested operation on the account.
*  Transaction details are recorded for audit and reference purposes.

**2.  BankingSystem manages accounts and transactions:**
*  Manages the list of registered users and their associated accounts.
*  Handles banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.
*  Records transaction details for each operation.

```ruby
import java.util.*;

class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String contactInfo;
    private String username;
    private String password;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Account {
    private String accountId;
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private AccountType accountType;
    private User user;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

enum AccountType {
    SAVINGS,
    CURRENT
}

class Transaction {
    private String transactionId;
    private String accountId;
    private TransactionType transactionType;
    private double amount;
    private Date timestamp;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

enum TransactionType {
    DEPOSIT,
    WITHDRAWAL,
    TRANSFER
}

class BankingSystem {
    private Map<String, User> users;
    private Map<String, Account> accounts;
    private List<Transaction> transactions;

    public BankingSystem() {
        this.users = new HashMap<>();
        this.accounts = new HashMap<>();
        this.transactions = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void registerUser(User user) {
        users.put(user.getUserId(), user);
    }

    public void openAccount(Account account) {
        accounts.put(account.getAccountId(), account);
    }

    public String performDeposit(String accountId, double amount) {
        Account account = accounts.get(accountId);
        if (account == null) {
            return "Account not found.";
        }

        account.setBalance(account.getBalance() + amount);
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction(generateTransactionId(), accountId, TransactionType.DEPOSIT, amount, new Date());
        transactions.add(transaction);

        return "Deposit successful.";
    }

    public String performWithdrawal(String accountId, double amount) {
        Account account = accounts.get(accountId);
        if (account == null) {
            return "Account not found.";
        }

        if (account.getBalance() < amount) {
            return "Insufficient funds.";
        }

        account.setBalance(account.getBalance() - amount);
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction(generateTransactionId(), accountId, TransactionType.WITHDRAWAL, amount, new Date());
        transactions.add(transaction);

        return "Withdrawal successful.";
    }

    public String performTransfer(String fromAccountId, String toAccountId, double amount) {
        Account fromAccount = accounts.get(fromAccountId);
        Account toAccount = accounts.get(toAccountId);

        if (fromAccount == null || toAccount == null) {
            return "One or both accounts not found.";
        }

        if (fromAccount.getBalance() < amount) {
            return "Insufficient funds.";
        }

        fromAccount.setBalance(fromAccount.getBalance() - amount);
        toAccount.setBalance(toAccount.getBalance() + amount);

        Transaction transaction = new Transaction(generateTransactionId(), fromAccountId, TransactionType.TRANSFER, amount, new Date());
        transactions.add(transaction);

        return "Transfer successful.";
    }

    private String generateTransactionId() {
        // Generate unique transaction ID logic
    }

    // Other methods for user authentication, transaction history, etc.
}
```

In this design:

*  The **User** class represents a user of the system with details like name, contact information, etc.
*  The **Account** class represents a bank account with details like account number, balance, account type, etc.
*  The **Transaction** class represents a transaction made on an account with details like transaction ID, amount, type, timestamp, etc.
*  The **BankingSystem** class manages users, accounts, transactions, and facilitates banking operations.

This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional features like authentication, authorization, encryption for sensitive information, concurrency control, logging, and database integration for data persistence.
