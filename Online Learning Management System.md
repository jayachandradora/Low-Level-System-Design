# Online Learning Management System

Designing an Online Learning Management System (LMS) involves managing various components such as courses, students, instructors, assignments, grades, and the system itself to facilitate learning activities. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

## Components:

**1.  Course:** Represents a course with details like course ID, title, instructor, description, etc. <br />
**2.  Student:** Represents a student enrolled in the system with details like student ID, name, contact information, etc. <br />
**3.  Instructor:** Represents an instructor with details like instructor ID, name, contact information, etc. <br />
**4.  Assignment:** Represents an assignment or task associated with a course. <br />
**5  Grade:** Represents the grade of a student for an assignment. <br />
**6.  LearningManagementSystem:** Manages courses, students, instructors, assignments, grades, and facilitates learning activities. <br />

## Interactions:

**1.  Student enrolls in a course:**
*  Student selects a course and enrolls in it.
*  LearningManagementSystem adds the student to the course roster.
  
**2.  Instructor creates an assignment:**
*  Instructor creates an assignment for a course.
*LearningManagementSystem adds the assignment to the course.

**3.  Student submits an assignment:**
*  Student completes an assignment and submits it.
*  LearningManagementSystem records the submission and notifies the instructor.
  
**4.  Instructor grades an assignment:**
*  Instructor evaluates the submitted assignment and assigns a grade. 
*  LearningManagementSystem records the grade and notifies the student.

class Course {
    private String courseId;
    private String title;
    private Instructor instructor;
    private List<Student> enrolledStudents;
    private List<Assignment> assignments;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Student {
    private String studentId;
    private String name;
    private String contactInfo;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Instructor {
    private String instructorId;
    private String name;
    private String contactInfo;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Assignment {
    private String assignmentId;
    private String title;
    private Course course;
    private Date deadline;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Grade {
    private String gradeId;
    private Assignment assignment;
    private Student student;
    private double score;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class LearningManagementSystem {
    private Map<String, Course> courses;
    private Map<String, List<Assignment>> courseAssignments;
    private Map<String, List<Grade>> courseGrades;

    public LearningManagementSystem() {
        this.courses = new HashMap<>();
        this.courseAssignments = new HashMap<>();
        this.courseGrades = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addCourse(Course course) {
        courses.put(course.getCourseId(), course);
        courseAssignments.put(course.getCourseId(), new ArrayList<>());
        courseGrades.put(course.getCourseId(), new ArrayList<>());
    }

    public void enrollStudent(String courseId, Student student) {
        Course course = courses.get(courseId);
        if (course != null) {
            course.getEnrolledStudents().add(student);
        }
    }

    public void createAssignment(String courseId, Assignment assignment) {
        List<Assignment> assignments = courseAssignments.get(courseId);
        if (assignments != null) {
            assignments.add(assignment);
        }
    }

    public void submitAssignment(String courseId, String assignmentId, Student student, double score) {
        List<Grade> grades = courseGrades.get(courseId);
        if (grades != null) {
            Assignment assignment = getAssignmentById(courseId, assignmentId);
            if (assignment != null) {
                grades.add(new Grade(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), assignment, student, score));
            }
        }
    }

    public Assignment getAssignmentById(String courseId, String assignmentId) {
        List<Assignment> assignments = courseAssignments.get(courseId);
        if (assignments != null) {
            for (Assignment assignment : assignments) {
                if (assignment.getAssignmentId().equals(assignmentId)) {
                    return assignment;
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public List<Grade> getGradesByCourse(String courseId) {
        return courseGrades.get(courseId);
    }

    // Other methods for instructor-specific operations, student-specific operations, etc.
}

```

In this design:

The Course class represents a course with details like course ID, title, instructor, etc.
The Student class represents a student enrolled in the system with details like student ID, name, etc.
The Instructor class represents an instructor with details like instructor ID, name, etc.
The Assignment class represents an assignment associated with a course.
The Grade class represents the grade of a student for an assignment.
The LearningManagementSystem class manages courses, students, instructors, assignments, grades, and facilitates learning activities.
This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional features like authentication, authorization, encryption for sensitive information, concurrency control, logging, and database integration for data persistence. Additionally, you may need to handle various types of courses (e.g., lectures, quizzes, exams), discussions, notifications, and more.
