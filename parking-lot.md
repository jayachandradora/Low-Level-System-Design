Designing a parking lot system is a classic problem in software design that can help illustrate principles of object-oriented design, data structures, and system behavior. Below is a low-level design (LLD) of a parking lot system in Java, along with explanations, use cases, and trade-offs.

### System Requirements

1. **Parking Lot**: Can have multiple levels, each with a certain number of spots.
2. **Parking Spots**: Can be of different types (compact, regular, oversized).
3. **Vehicles**: Can be cars, bikes, or trucks.
4. **Operations**:
   - Park a vehicle
   - Remove a vehicle
   - Check available spots
   - Track parked vehicles

### Classes and Relationships

#### 1. Vehicle Class

```java
public abstract class Vehicle {
    protected String licensePlate;
    protected VehicleSize size;

    public Vehicle(String licensePlate, VehicleSize size) {
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
        this.size = size;
    }

    public String getLicensePlate() {
        return licensePlate;
    }

    public VehicleSize getSize() {
        return size;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Specific Vehicle Types

```java
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate, VehicleSize.COMPACT);
    }
}

public class Bike extends Vehicle {
    public Bike(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate, VehicleSize.MOTORCYCLE);
    }
}

public class Truck extends Vehicle {
    public Truck(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate, VehicleSize.LARGE);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Vehicle Size Enum

```java
public enum VehicleSize {
    MOTORCYCLE,
    COMPACT,
    LARGE
}
```

#### 4. ParkingSpot Class

```java
public class ParkingSpot {
    private VehicleSize size;
    private Vehicle currentVehicle;
    private boolean isAvailable;

    public ParkingSpot(VehicleSize size) {
        this.size = size;
        this.isAvailable = true;
    }

    public boolean park(Vehicle vehicle) {
        if (isAvailable && vehicle.getSize() == size) {
            this.currentVehicle = vehicle;
            isAvailable = false;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public Vehicle remove() {
        Vehicle vehicle = currentVehicle;
        currentVehicle = null;
        isAvailable = true;
        return vehicle;
    }

    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return isAvailable;
    }

    public VehicleSize getSize() {
        return size;
    }
}
```

#### 5. ParkingLot Class

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class ParkingLot {
    private List<ParkingSpot> spots;
    private Map<String, Vehicle> parkedVehicles;

    public ParkingLot(int numCompact, int numLarge, int numMotorcycle) {
        spots = new ArrayList<>();
        parkedVehicles = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCompact; i++) {
            spots.add(new ParkingSpot(VehicleSize.COMPACT));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < numLarge; i++) {
            spots.add(new ParkingSpot(VehicleSize.LARGE));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < numMotorcycle; i++) {
            spots.add(new ParkingSpot(VehicleSize.MOTORCYCLE));
        }
    }

    public boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (ParkingSpot spot : spots) {
            if (spot.park(vehicle)) {
                parkedVehicles.put(vehicle.getLicensePlate(), vehicle);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false; // No available spots
    }

    public Vehicle removeVehicle(String licensePlate) {
        Vehicle vehicle = parkedVehicles.remove(licensePlate);
        if (vehicle != null) {
            for (ParkingSpot spot : spots) {
                if (!spot.isAvailable() && spot.getSize() == vehicle.getSize()) {
                    return spot.remove();
                }
            }
        }
        return null; // Vehicle not found
    }

    public int availableSpots() {
        int count = 0;
        for (ParkingSpot spot : spots) {
            if (spot.isAvailable()) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Use Cases

1. **Parking a Vehicle**: When a vehicle arrives, the system finds the first available spot that matches the vehicle's size.
2. **Removing a Vehicle**: When a vehicle leaves, the system frees up the spot, making it available for future vehicles.
3. **Checking Availability**: The system can provide the number of available parking spots at any time.

### Trade-offs

1. **Simplicity vs. Scalability**: 
   - This design is straightforward but may not scale well with an increasing number of vehicles or complex parking strategies (like reserving spots). Adding features such as multi-level parking or dynamic spot allocation can complicate the design.

2. **Performance**:
   - The current implementation uses a linear search to find available spots. In a larger system, using a more efficient data structure (like a priority queue) for managing available spots could improve performance.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - The design is somewhat rigid in terms of vehicle types. If you want to add new vehicle types, you need to modify the code in multiple places (Vehicle class, ParkingSpot handling). Using a more flexible design pattern (like Strategy or Factory) could alleviate this issue.

4. **Concurrency**:
   - This design does not handle concurrent access to parking spots. If multiple threads attempt to park or remove vehicles simultaneously, you may run into race conditions. Adding synchronization or using concurrent data structures would be necessary in a real-world application.

### Conclusion

This parking lot design in Java demonstrates key principles of object-oriented programming and encapsulation. The simplicity of the design makes it easy to understand and implement, while trade-offs related to performance, scalability, and concurrency should be carefully considered for production-level systems.
