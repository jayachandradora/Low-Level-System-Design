# ATM (Automated Teller Machine) System

Designing an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) System involves managing various components such as users, accounts, transactions, and the system itself to facilitate banking operations. Here's a low-level design example in Java:

## Components:

**1.  User:** Represents a user of the ATM system with details like user ID, name, PIN, etc. <br />
**2.  Account:** Represents a bank account associated with a user with details like account number, balance, account type, etc.<br />
**3.  Transaction:** Represents a transaction made at the ATM with details like transaction ID, amount, type, timestamp, etc.<br />
**4.  ATMSystem:** Manages users, accounts, transactions, and facilitates ATM operations.<br />

## Interactions:

**1.  User logs in to the ATM:**
*  User enters the user ID and PIN.
*  ATMSystem validates the user's credentials.

**2.  User performs banking operations:**
*  User selects the desired banking operation (e.g., balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit).
*  ATMSystem performs the requested operation on the user's account.

**3.  ATMSystem manages accounts and transactions:**
*  Manages the list of registered users and their associated accounts.
*  Handles banking operations like balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit, etc.
*  Records transaction details for each operation.

```ruby
import java.util.*;

class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private int pin;
    private List<Account> accounts;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

class Account {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private AccountType accountType;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

enum AccountType {
    SAVINGS,
    CURRENT
}

class Transaction {
    private String transactionId;
    private String accountId;
    private TransactionType transactionType;
    private double amount;
    private Date timestamp;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}

enum TransactionType {
    BALANCE_INQUIRY,
    WITHDRAWAL,
    DEPOSIT
}

class ATMSystem {
    private Map<String, User> users;
    private Map<String, Account> accounts;
    private List<Transaction> transactions;

    public ATMSystem() {
        this.users = new HashMap<>();
        this.accounts = new HashMap<>();
        this.transactions = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void registerUser(User user) {
        users.put(user.getUserId(), user);
        for (Account account : user.getAccounts()) {
            accounts.put(account.getAccountNumber(), account);
        }
    }

    public boolean authenticateUser(String userId, int pin) {
        User user = users.get(userId);
        return user != null && user.getPin() == pin;
    }

    public double checkBalance(String accountNumber) {
        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);
        return account != null ? account.getBalance() : -1; // Return -1 if account not found
    }

    public boolean withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount) {
        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);
        if (account != null && account.getBalance() >= amount) {
            account.setBalance(account.getBalance() - amount);
            transactions.add(new Transaction(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), accountNumber, TransactionType.WITHDRAWAL, amount, new Date()));
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount) {
        Account account = accounts.get(accountNumber);
        if (account != null) {
            account.setBalance(account.getBalance() + amount);
            transactions.add(new Transaction(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), accountNumber, TransactionType.DEPOSIT, amount, new Date()));
        }
    }

    // Other methods for transaction history, etc.
}
```
In this design:

*  The **User** class represents a user of the ATM system with details like user ID, name, PIN, etc.
*  The **Account** class represents a bank account associated with a user with details like account number, balance, account type, etc.
*  The **Transaction** class represents a transaction made at the ATM with details like transaction ID, amount, type, timestamp, etc.
*  The **ATMSystem** class manages users, accounts, transactions, and facilitates ATM operations.

This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional features like authentication timeout, transaction limits, card capture, receipt printing, and more. Additionally, error handling, concurrency control, and database integration would be crucial for a production-level system.
