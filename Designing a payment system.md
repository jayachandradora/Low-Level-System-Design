Designing a payment system for applications like hotel management, ticket booking, or flight booking involves multiple components, each responsible for handling different aspects of the payment process. Below, I'll provide a low-level design focusing on key classes and interactions within a payment system.

### Components of the Payment System

1. **Payment Gateway**: Interface for processing payments.
2. **Payment Method**: Interface for different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
3. **Order**: Represents a booking or transaction.
4. **User**: Represents the customer making a payment.
5. **Payment Processor**: Handles the interaction with the payment gateway.
6. **Transaction**: Represents the transaction details.

### Class Diagram

Here's a high-level class diagram representation (described in text):

```
+------------------+         +--------------------+
|      User        |         |      Order         |
+------------------+         +--------------------+
| - userId         |<>-------| - orderId          |
| - name           |         | - amount           |
| - email          |         | - status           |
+------------------+         +--------------------+
        |                               |
        |                               |
        |                               |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+
| PaymentMethod     |<---------|   PaymentProcessor   |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+
| +pay()            |          | +processPayment()    |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+
        ^                               |
        |                               |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+
| CreditCardPayment |          |  PaymentGateway      |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+
| - cardNumber      |          | +authorize()         |
| - expiryDate      |          | +capture()           |
| +pay()            |          | +refund()            |
+-------------------+          +---------------------+
```

### Classes and Their Responsibilities

#### 1. User Class

```java
public class User {
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructor, Getters, and Setters
}
```

#### 2. Order Class

```java
public class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private double amount;
    private String status; // e.g., "PENDING", "COMPLETED", "FAILED"

    // Constructor, Getters, and Setters
}
```

#### 3. PaymentMethod Interface

```java
public interface PaymentMethod {
    boolean pay(double amount);
}
```

#### 4. CreditCardPayment Class

```java
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
    private String cardNumber;
    private String expiryDate;

    public CreditCardPayment(String cardNumber, String expiryDate) {
        this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
        this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean pay(double amount) {
        // Payment processing logic
        // Validate card details and process payment through PaymentProcessor
        return true; // Assume payment is successful for simplicity
    }
}
```

#### 5. PaymentProcessor Class

```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGateway gateway;

    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentGateway gateway) {
        this.gateway = gateway;
    }

    public boolean processPayment(PaymentMethod method, Order order) {
        if (method.pay(order.getAmount())) {
            // Assuming payment was successful
            order.setStatus("COMPLETED");
            return true;
        } else {
            order.setStatus("FAILED");
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 6. PaymentGateway Class

```java
public class PaymentGateway {
    public boolean authorize(double amount) {
        // Authorize payment logic (e.g., interact with external payment service)
        return true; // Simulating successful authorization
    }

    public boolean capture(double amount) {
        // Capture payment logic
        return true; // Simulating successful capture
    }

    public boolean refund(double amount) {
        // Refund payment logic
        return true; // Simulating successful refund
    }
}
```

### Usage Example

```java
public class PaymentSystemDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        User user = new User("1", "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");
        Order order = new Order("123", 200.00, "PENDING");

        // Create payment method
        PaymentMethod paymentMethod = new CreditCardPayment("4111111111111111", "12/25");

        // Create payment processor and gateway
        PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();
        PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(paymentGateway);

        // Process payment
        boolean paymentSuccess = paymentProcessor.processPayment(paymentMethod, order);

        System.out.println("Payment Success: " + paymentSuccess);
        System.out.println("Order Status: " + order.getStatus());
    }
}
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Extensibility**: The design allows for adding new payment methods (e.g., PayPal, bank transfer) without changing existing code.
2. **Encapsulation**: Payment logic is encapsulated within the respective classes.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a specific responsibility, making the system more maintainable and testable.
4. **Error Handling**: Real implementations would require robust error handling, logging, and security measures (e.g., PCI compliance).

### Use Cases

1. **Hotel Management**: Manage reservations, payments for stays, and cancellation policies.
2. **Ticket Booking**: Handle payments for events, flights, or travel.
3. **Flight Booking**: Process payments for airline tickets, including baggage fees and extras.

### Conclusion

This low-level design of a payment system provides a flexible and scalable approach for managing payments across various applications. By using design patterns like Strategy and encapsulation, we ensure that the system is both easy to maintain and extend as new requirements arise.
